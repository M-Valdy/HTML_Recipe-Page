        <h1>The Traditional Mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary</h1>
        <p>The Rosary is one of the most important and well-known prayers of the Catholic faith invites the faithful to meditate on key events in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ through the eyes of His Blessed Mother. Before Pope John Paul II introduced the Mysteries of Light in 2022, these reflections are organized into three sets of Mysteries: Joyful, Sorrowful, and Glorious. On this page, we explore these three traditional Mysteries, their meaning, and how they draw us closer to the life of Christ and the love of Mary.</p>

        <h2>Joyful Mysteries</h2>
        <p>Consisting of the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Nativity of Our Lord, the Presentation, and the Finding of Jesus in the temple. The Joyful Mysteries of the Rosary are meant for us to meditate on the Childhood of our Lord Jesus Christ through the eyes of his mother, Mary. This mystery is traditionally said on Mondays, Thursdays and the Sundays of Christmas and Advent.</p>
