        <p>KPOP Demon Hunters is a very unique film to say the least. The plot basically revolves around the popular KPOP girl group Huntr/x; who aside from doing typical idol stuff, also fights demons on their spare time. They eventually have to go against demons who take on the form of a rival boy group called the Saja Boys. </p>
        <p><strong>Movie Rating:</strong>
        <span aria-hidden="true">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆☆</span> (8/10)
        </p>
        <p>The plot was interesting, the soundtrack was extremely catching, and the characters were amazing. But the world of the show had too many questions unanswered, and most of the characters required a lot more development than they got. Even among the characters that were developed, their backstories could have still be further elaborated on.</p>
